# darkeco-dataset-prep

Data preparation pipeline for the [Dark Ecology Dataset](https://github.com/darkecology/darkeco-dataset). Processes vertical profiles of biological activity (output from the [`cajun`](https://github.com/darkecology/wsrlib/blob/master/src/radar/cajun.m) function in [wsrlib](https://github.com/darkecology/wsrlib)) into summary datasets at scan, 5-minute, and daily temporal resolutions across ~160 NEXRAD stations since 1995.

See README in [`scripts/`](scripts/) folder for pipeline details.
